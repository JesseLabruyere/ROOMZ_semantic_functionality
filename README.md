# Semantic functionality in C&#35;
Example implementation that communicates with a remote SPARQL store using the dotNetRDF library.

## How it works
This project was developed and can be run with MonoDevelop. When the project is run the main loop inside SemanticBrowserTest starts and you are able to both browse uris and see the corresponding triples inside the terminal. The SPARQL endpoint that is used in the example: http://195.93.238.56:3030/portfolios/query.
